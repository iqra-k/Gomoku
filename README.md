# Gomoku
This project implements a simple AI engine for the 8x8 board game of Gomoku. The game is played by two players with one using black stones and the other using white stones. A player makes a move by placing a stone on an empty square. The player with black stones moves first, followed by alternating turns. A player wins by placing five of their stones in a sequence either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
